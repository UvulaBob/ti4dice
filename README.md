Twilight Imperium 4 Dice Roller
=
Have you left your dice somewhere else? Do you completely trust Math.random()? Then have I got the app for you!

What This Does
-
This app will take the number of each ship you specify, and roll their corresponding number of d10s. Every ship gets one d10 each, except for War Suns, which  get 3d10 each. 

How To Do It
-
Click the button foreach ship to add one to your fleet. You can also choose the applicable modifiers on the right side. When you're ready to roll, click "Roll Dice" and revel in modern technology. 

Why This Exists
-
Someone once told me that rather than think of uses for technology, they think of something they want to do, and apply technology to it. I'm not quite there, but I needed to learn React, so here we are.
